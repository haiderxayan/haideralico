## What changed

- Reworked the homepage hero layout to better fit large displays and keep the book cover aligned with the content column.
- Swapped the "Recent Writing" feed to draw directly from the living manuscript so readers see the latest chapters immediately.
- Tuned spacing across About, Contact, and Search to match the book's notebook aesthetic.

## Why it matters

Each update keeps the web experience in sync with the evolving manuscript and makes it clearer what shipped recently. Readers land in a layout that mirrors the book's structure and can track changes without hunting through blog posts.
