        <p>
          I'm a design leader, author, and digital experience architect who guides enterprises through the complexity
          of UX, AI, and large-scale design systems. At Aramco, I direct enterprise design platforms that support
          thousands of employees and partners, building systems that keep products coherent while they evolve.
        </p>
        <p>
          Over two decades—from a small bookshop I ran at 14 to launching global programs—I've learned that the teams
          who win are the ones who treat experience as a living system. My work blends qualitative research, data-informed
          decisions, and a bias for iteration so we can release, learn, and adapt without losing rigor.
        </p>
        <p>
          Today I advise leaders, coach teams, and write about the future of digital experience. Whether it's AI-assisted
          product discovery, governance for enterprise design systems, or framing the story that gets executives aligned,
          my focus is simple: help teams build products that earn trust every day.

        <p>
          Every engagement starts with context. We map the humans in the loop, surface the constraints that shape their
          work, and connect strategy to execution. I build teams that ship in sprints without losing sight of the system,
          weaving research, governance, and craft together.
        </p>
        <p>
          My framework—Plan, Build, Learn, Scale—keeps momentum steady. We set direction, launch the smallest valuable
          version, capture real feedback, then scale what works across the organization.

      <p>
        The through-line in everything I ship is curiosity. I care about how people make decisions, the systems that
        restrict them, and the rituals that help them progress. The book, newsletter, workshops, and consulting practice
        are all expressions of that curiosity.
