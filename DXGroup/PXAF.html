# Scope of Work
## Product Experience Assessment Framework

**Owning Department:** Digital & AI Center of Excellence

---

## 1. Project Overview

**Project Name:** Product Experience Assessment Framework (PXAF)

**Current Phase:** Discovery

**Date:** November 2025

### Purpose
To establish a comprehensive Product Experience Assessment Framework that enables the Digital & AI Center of Excellence team to standardize user experience metrics across all digital products and initiatives. This framework will serve as a compliance mechanism ensuring all product launches meet established excellence standards before deployment.

### Background
As the Digital & AI Center of Excellence team, we support multiple entities and product owners launching digital products and initiatives aimed at improving organizational productivity. Currently, there is no standardized mechanism to ensure these products meet consistent user experience standards. This creates risk of:
- Inconsistent user experiences across the digital ecosystem
- Products launching without adequate UX validation
- Lack of baseline metrics to measure improvement claims
- No systematic way to enforce compliance with experience standards

### Project Vision
Create an embedded compliance framework where product experience excellence is built into every stage of the product lifecycle, not just audited at the end. Teams will have self-service tools to assess and improve their products continuously, with the Digital & AI Center of Excellence providing governance through ServiceNow-based audit submissions and approvals. This ensures every product launch delivers demonstrable user experience excellence.

## 2. Objectives

### Primary Objectives
1. **Develop a Standardized Scoring System**
   - Create quantifiable metrics for evaluating product experience across all digital initiatives
   - Establish clear scoring criteria that measure UX quality, accessibility, usability, and performance
   - Define minimum thresholds for product launch approval

2. **Establish Baseline Metrics**
   - Define organizational benchmarks for product experience excellence
   - Create measurement standards applicable across different product types and initiatives
   - Enable consistent comparison and tracking of improvements over time

3. **Create a Self-Service Audit Toolkit**
   - Develop comprehensive tools enabling product teams to conduct their own assessments
   - Provide guidelines, checklists, and evaluation templates
   - Include educational resources to build UX capability across teams

4. **Embed Compliance into Product Lifecycle**
   - Integrate assessment checkpoints throughout the product development process (not just at launch)
   - Create stage-gated compliance requirements from conception to deployment
   - Ensure continuous alignment with excellence standards throughout development

5. **Implement ServiceNow Integration**
   - Establish audit submission and approval workflow through ServiceNow
   - Create centralized tracking and reporting mechanism
   - Enable Center of Excellence team to review and approve product launches based on compliance evidence

### Secondary Objectives
- Build organizational capability in product experience excellence
- Create transparency in product quality across the organization
- Reduce post-launch UX issues and rework
- Foster a culture of user-centered design and continuous improvement

## 9. Out of Scope

### Explicitly Out of Scope for Discovery Phase

**Actual Implementation Work**
- Building the complete toolkit (only specifications created in discovery)
- ServiceNow configuration and development
- Training content creation (only curriculum design)
- Full organizational rollout
- Pilot execution (only planning)

**Product-Specific Work**
- Conducting actual audits on existing products
- Fixing UX issues in current products
- Providing consulting services to individual product teams
- Detailed design reviews of specific initiatives

**Technical Development**
- Custom software development beyond ServiceNow configuration
- Integration with tools outside ServiceNow
- Automated testing or monitoring tools
- Building assessment algorithms or AI-powered scoring

### Out of Scope for Overall Initiative

**Not Within Framework's Mandate**
- Ownership of product design decisions (remains with product owners)
- Day-to-day UX work for product teams
- Competitive product analysis
- Market research and user research for specific products
- Technical performance optimization (unless impacts user experience)
- Security audits or technical code reviews
- Project management of individual product initiatives

**Process Ownership Boundaries**
- This framework provides assessment and compliance validation
- Product teams retain ownership of actual UX improvement work
- Digital & AI Center of Excellence is not a design agency or UX consultancy
- Teams are responsible for achieving compliance, not the Digital & AI CoE

**Technology Limitations**
- Creating new platforms or systems beyond ServiceNow integration
- Replacing existing project management or design tools
- Building comprehensive analytics or business intelligence platforms
- Automated UX testing infrastructure

**Organizational Change**
- Restructuring teams or reporting lines
- Changing budget allocation processes
- Modifying HR policies or job descriptions
- Altering governance structures beyond this specific compliance process

### Future Considerations (Potential Phase 2+)

These items are not in current scope but may be considered for future phases:
- AI-powered assessment recommendations
- Automated compliance monitoring and alerts
- Integration with design tools (Figma, Adobe XD)
- Industry benchmarking and competitive analysis features
- Advanced analytics and predictive insights
- Certification program for product excellence
- Community of practice and knowledge sharing platform
- Extended assessment for customer support and service experience
