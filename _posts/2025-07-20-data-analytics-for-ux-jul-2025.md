Turn behavioral data into decisions with pragmatic schemas and a crisp workflow from analysis to action.

## Establish an Event Taxonomy

Define a naming convention that captures action, object, and context (`task_completed`, `settings_save`, `onboarding_step_viewed`). Document required properties (device, plan, experiment id) and optional metadata. Store the taxonomy in a shared reference so product, engineering, and analytics implement consistently.

## Map Funnels to Journeys

For each critical journey (activation, upgrade, retention), outline the funnel steps, success metrics, and supporting diagnostics. Example: Activation funnel for project creation might include onboarding completion, template selection, first collaboration. Track drop-off and time-between-steps to understand friction.

## Build Diagnostics Dashboards

Dashboards should tell a story, not just chart events. Combine:

- Completion rates and step drop-offs
- Segment filters (persona, plan, geography)
- Cohort trends over time
- Links to qualitative insights or support tickets

Use annotations to mark launches or experiments that influence trends.

## Workflow from Insight to Action

1. **Discover:** Analysts or designers spot anomalies in dashboards.
2. **Diagnose:** Pair quantitative data with session replays or interviews.
3. **Decide:** Document hypotheses and proposed solutions in a shared backlog.
4. **Deliver:** Implement changes and tag them with experiment IDs.
5. **Document:** Update the analytics playbook with outcomes and lessons learned.

## Collaboration Rituals

Hold biweekly analytics reviews where designers and PMs walk through metrics. Rotate presenters so everyone understands the data. Share pre-read summaries so meeting time focuses on decisions.

## Checklist for Analytics-Driven UX

- [ ] Event taxonomy documented and accessible
- [ ] Funnels mapped to customer journeys with diagnostics
- [ ] Dashboards include segmentation, annotations, and qualitative links
- [ ] Insight-to-action workflow established with ownership
- [ ] Regular analytics reviews scheduled with cross-functional teams

When analytics are structured thoughtfully, they empower UX teams to argue for roadmap investments with confidence.

## Case Study: Activation Funnel Fix

At a SaaS client, we noticed a 40% drop-off between trial signup and first project creation. By instrumenting additional events and pairing them with support ticket analysis, we discovered that users lacked sample data. The team introduced guided templates and an in-app checklist, then tracked the funnel again. Activation climbed by 18% and support tickets fell by a third. Documenting this story helped secure future investment in analytics tooling.
