Patterns reduce cognitive load and accelerate delivery. We outline guardrails for reuse that keep experiences coherent without stifling innovation.

## Start with a Pattern Inventory

Audit existing flows and catalog core interaction types—navigation, forms, data tables, creation flows, feedback states. Document intent, accessibility considerations, and links to design system components. This inventory becomes your baseline for reuse decisions.

## Reuse vs. Invent Framework

Ask three questions before inventing a new pattern:

1. **Does an existing pattern solve 80% of the problem?** If yes, adapt it with minor tweaks.
2. **Is the context truly novel or high risk?** New modalities or regulatory constraints may demand invention.
3. **Can we validate a new pattern quickly?** If testing will be slow, stick with known patterns.

## Validation Workflow

- Prototype the interaction with realistic data.
- Run targeted usability sessions focusing on discoverability and error recovery.
- Measure task success, completion time, and satisfaction.
- Iterate with cross-functional feedback before shipping.

## Documenting Patterns

Each pattern entry should include:

- Purpose and usage guidance
- Anatomy with component references
- Content guidelines and microcopy examples
- Accessibility notes (keyboard focus, ARIA roles)
- Variants and responsive behavior
- Telemetry events for analytics

Store the documentation in your design system hub so teams can find it quickly.

## Measuring Pattern Health

Monitor adoption, usability feedback, and maintenance effort. If a pattern drives frequent support tickets or requires constant overrides, revisit the design. Schedule quarterly audits to ensure patterns still fit evolving product ecosystems.

## Checklist for Interaction Patterns

- [ ] Inventory existing patterns with metadata
- [ ] Reuse vs. invent questions answered and recorded
- [ ] Prototypes tested with representative users
- [ ] Documentation covers usage, content, accessibility, and telemetry
- [ ] Metrics monitored for adoption and quality

Patterns are only as strong as their governance. With disciplined documentation and validation, they empower teams to move fast without breaking cohesion.

### Mini Case Study

While revamping a billing dashboard, our team debated introducing a novel accordion pattern. We ran quick usability tests comparing the new interaction against an existing expandable table. Users completed tasks faster with the familiar table and appreciated the consistent controls. We scrapped the accordion, updated the pattern documentation with findings, and noted when a new pattern might be justified (mobile-first, limited space). Capturing the rationale prevented the debate from resurfacing months later.
