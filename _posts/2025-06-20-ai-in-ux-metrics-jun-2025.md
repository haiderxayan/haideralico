We propose a lightweight metric stack that complements product KPIs and captures user‑level confidence and outcome quality.

## Why Traditional Metrics Fall Short

Clicks and time-on-task do not reveal whether AI outputs are helpful, safe, or trusted. AI experiences require a layered metric strategy that captures intent coverage, quality, and user sentiment. Without it, teams chase vanity numbers while harmful edge cases persist.

## Core Metric Categories

1. **Intent Coverage**
   - Percentage of user intents the AI can handle confidently.
   - Track fallback rates to human workflows or manual tools.

2. **Outcome Quality**
   - Human-rated accuracy or usefulness scores; sample regularly.
   - Post-action regret: ask users if they would repeat the AI-assisted step.

3. **User Confidence and Trust**
   - Confidence ratings collected after key interactions.
   - Complaint volume or support tickets referencing the AI feature.

4. **Safety and Compliance**
   - Toxicity or bias flags from automated classifiers.
   - Policy violations caught by moderation layers.

## Instrumentation Tips

- Embed lightweight feedback prompts (“Did this answer help?”) with optional comments.
- Sample interactions for expert review; rate on clarity, correctness, and tone.
- Log model version, prompts, and context for auditability.
- Segment metrics by user cohort; trust varies dramatically across experience levels and regions.

## Closing the Loop

Metrics should feed back into product and model updates. Establish a weekly triage where designers, PMs, and engineers review anomalies. If regret scores rise, investigate prompt templates, training data, or UI cues. Share findings transparently with stakeholders to maintain accountability.

## Dashboard Essentials

- Coverage vs. fallback trend lines
- Accuracy and regret rates by task
- Confidence scores over time
- Safety incidents with root causes
- Experiment annotations showing when prompts or UI changed

## Checklist

- [ ] Define intents and log coverage
- [ ] Collect outcome quality via human review or ratings
- [ ] Measure confidence, regret, and support tickets
- [ ] Monitor safety incidents with automated and manual checks
- [ ] Review metrics with cross-functional stakeholders weekly
- [ ] Tie improvements back to roadmap decisions

AI UX thrives when teams measure what truly matters: reliable outcomes and user trust.

## Getting Started This Quarter

1. **Audit existing dashboards** for AI features and identify missing metrics—especially regret and safety signals.
2. **Instrument lightweight surveys** that capture confidence immediately after AI-assisted actions.
3. **Stand up a review pod** with design, product, data, and support to triage findings weekly.
4. **Close the loop with users** by communicating improvements driven by their feedback; transparency builds trust.

Treat metrics as a product. Iterating on what you measure is just as important as iterating on the interface itself.
