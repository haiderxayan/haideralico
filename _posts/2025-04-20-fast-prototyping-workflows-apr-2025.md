Prototype to learn, not to ship: we cover the minimum viable artifacts that validate value, usability, and feasibility quickly.

## Define the Learning Agenda

Before opening Figma or code, write down what you need to learn:

- **Value:** Will users care enough to try this?
- **Usability:** Can they complete the core tasks without guidance?
- **Feasibility:** Can engineering deliver it within constraints?

Each question deserves a prototype tailored to the fidelity required. Overbuilding wastes time; underbuilding yields misleading feedback.

## Layered Fidelity Approach

1. **Concept sketches:** Start with Crazy 8s or storyboards to explore directions. Use these in stakeholder alignment sessions.
2. **Clickable flows:** Build mid-fidelity prototypes with real copy and core interactions. Ideal for usability interviews.
3. **Data-backed simulations:** When logic matters (pricing, personalization), prototype in tools like ProtoPie, Framer, or lightweight React sandboxes.

Document which fidelity level serves which learning goals so the team knows when to move on.

## Reuse Components from Your System

Import design system components into prototypes to stay consistent and speed assembly. If you need a new pattern, flag it with the design system team early. Annotate the prototype with component names so developers know the intended mapping.

## Collaborate in Real Time

Establish daily syncs or async updates in Slack/Notion to share progress, blockers, and feedback. Invite engineering to critique prototypes early—technical insights often simplify interactions or prevent future rework. Encourage product managers to test with stakeholders and bring back insights quickly.

## Testing Cadence

Treat prototypes as disposable learning artifacts:

- Run 3–5 participant usability sessions per iteration; look for repeating friction rather than statistical significance.
- Complement qualitative feedback with analytics from tools like Maze or Useberry for completion rates and heatmaps.
- Capture findings in a centralized research repository linked to the prototype version tested.

## Handoff and Documentation

When a concept is validated, create a concise handoff package:

- Updated user flows and scenarios
- Annotated screens with interaction notes and accessibility requirements
- Open questions or known gaps
- Links to usability findings and prioritization rationale

This package turns prototypes into actionable delivery work.

## Checklist for Fast, Responsible Prototyping

- [ ] Learning goals defined with priority
- [ ] Fidelity level matches the question being answered
- [ ] Design system components reused or flagged for addition
- [ ] Cross-functional feedback loop in place
- [ ] Testing cadence scheduled with participants
- [ ] Handoff documentation linked to research evidence

Prototyping should accelerate decisions, not create pixel debt. With a layered approach and disciplined documentation, teams can pivot quickly while keeping everyone aligned.
