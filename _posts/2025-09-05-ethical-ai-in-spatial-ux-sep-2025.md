We discuss guardrails for model uncertainty, consent, and recovery—without breaking immersion.

## Understand the Spatial AI Context

Spatial UX blends physical environments with digital overlays. When AI guides interactions—suggesting paths, adjusting lighting, personalizing content—the stakes rise. Missteps can disorient users or compromise privacy. Ethical design ensures immersion never overrides safety.

## Managing Model Uncertainty

- **Confidence visualizations:** Show subtle color cues or icons indicating AI certainty. Let users request alternative suggestions when confidence is low.
- **Explainability surfaces:** Provide tooltips or voice prompts describing why a recommendation appears (“Based on your last three sessions in the studio”).
- **Fallback behaviors:** When confidence drops below a threshold, revert to manual controls or human assistance.

## Consent and Privacy

Spatial experiences often rely on sensors (cameras, LiDAR, biometrics). Obtain explicit consent for each data type. Use layered disclosures that summarize data use before allowing deeper dives. Offer a privacy dashboard to review and revoke permissions. For shared spaces, surface session status so bystanders know when recording occurs.

## Safety and Recovery

- **Boundary alerts:** Warn users when they approach physical obstacles, even if AI believes a path is clear.
- **Pause and resume controls:** Enable quick gestures or voice commands to pause AI guidance instantly.
- **Incident reporting:** Provide a simple way to flag uncomfortable or unsafe AI behavior. Route reports to a responsible team with response SLAs.

## Inclusive Testing

Test with diverse body types, mobility ranges, and accessibility needs. Observe how lighting, noise, and cultural expectations affect perception. Include edge cases like assistive devices or crowded environments. Document findings and adjust defaults accordingly.

## Governance

Set up an ethics review cadence for spatial AI features. Track decisions, mitigations, and unresolved risks in a central log. Align with legal, security, and safety teams to monitor compliance with emerging regulations.

## Checklist for Ethical Spatial AI

- [ ] Confidence signals and fallback flows implemented
- [ ] Consent flows cover sensor data and bystander awareness
- [ ] Pause/resume controls accessible in all modes
- [ ] Incident reporting pipeline staffed and measured
- [ ] Diverse participant testing completed with documented findings
- [ ] Governance log updated with each release

When immersive products treat safety and consent as non-negotiables, users can enjoy spatial experiences with confidence.
