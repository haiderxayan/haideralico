A concise list of patterns that reduce ambiguity, respect privacy, and keep users in control.

## Voice UI Do’s

- **Do design intent-focused prompts.** Lead with the action users want to accomplish, not system jargon. Example: “Ready to reorder your last grocery list?”
- **Do provide brief confirmations.** Reinforce successful actions with short acknowledgments and next steps (“Done. I’ll remind you tomorrow at 9am.”).
- **Do offer multimodal cues.** Pair voice feedback with visual or haptic signals so users know the system heard them.
- **Do let users interrupt.** Support barge-in so users can correct or cancel commands mid-sentence.
- **Do respect privacy.** Provide easy ways to mute, adjust recording settings, and review transcripts. Default to minimal data retention.

## Voice UI Don’ts

- **Don’t overload memory.** Avoid multi-step instructions without checkpoints. Break complex tasks into smaller exchanges.
- **Don’t mimic human small talk.** Stay purposeful—overly casual responses can feel uncanny or waste time.
- **Don’t hide limitations.** If the system cannot perform a request, say so clearly and offer alternatives.
- **Don’t default to sensitive speech.** For billing or personal data, confirm via a secure channel or require a PIN.
- **Don’t ignore ambient noise.** Test in realistic environments; provide user feedback when audio quality prevents accurate recognition.

## Design Checklist

- Intent library prioritized by user value
- Scripts written with plain language and progressive disclosure
- Error states logged with recovery suggestions
- Privacy controls surfaced early in onboarding
- Metrics in place: intent success rate, fallback rate, satisfaction

Thoughtful voice interfaces give users agency. Following these do’s and don’ts ensures assistants remain helpful companions, not frustrating gatekeepers.

### Practice Scenario

Run a tabletop exercise with your team: script a common task (e.g., reordering medication) and walk through it using the checklist above. Capture where the conversation stalls, whether confirmations feel natural, and how privacy considerations change in shared spaces. Iterate the script, then test with real users to validate improvements.

### Instrumentation Essentials

- Track intent success rate, follow-up prompts, and manual handoffs.
- Monitor wake word false positives to protect privacy and reduce frustration.
- Capture qualitative feedback through short post-interaction surveys or in-app feedback cards.
- Review transcripts weekly to spot conversational dead ends or bias.

Measurement keeps your checklist grounded in real behavior.
