We map useful AI skills (prompt shaping, evaluation, dataset prep) to common design scenarios, with ways to practice safely on real work.

## Skill 1: Prompt Shaping for Research and Ideation

Designers increasingly use AI to synthesize interviews, generate copy, or explore interface variations. Effective prompt shaping means structuring context, constraints, and guardrails. Practice by taking an existing research synthesis and asking an AI to propose design themes—then refine prompts to improve accuracy and tone.

## Skill 2: Evaluation and QA

AI outputs require skeptical review. Learn to create evaluation rubrics: clarity, accuracy, bias, tone. Pair qualitative judgment with lightweight scoring so feedback loops can feed model fine-tuning. Work with data teams to sample outputs weekly and log findings in a shared tracker.

## Skill 3: Dataset Curation

Designers often own the language and content surfaces used for fine-tuning. Build skills in selecting representative examples, annotating intent, and cleaning labels. Understand privacy policies and remove sensitive data before training.

## Skill 4: Ethics and Safety Stewardship

Designers are uniquely positioned to advocate for user well-being. Learn to run harm assessments, identify dark patterns in AI interactions, and propose mitigations. Participate in governance reviews to ensure releases respect consent and transparency requirements.

## Skill 5: Cross-Functional Communication

AI work touches engineering, data science, legal, and support. Practice translating user needs into technical requirements, and vice versa. Host brown-bag sessions where teams share decisions and learnings. Document AI feature rationale so stakeholders understand trade-offs.

## How to Practice

- Join or start an internal AI working group.
- Take on a pilot project: for example, redesigning an onboarding flow with AI-driven personalization.
- Shadow data scientists to understand model pipelines, then contribute to evaluation scripts.
- Set quarterly learning goals (coursework, conference talks, mentorship) and track progress.

## Portfolio Proof Points

Highlight projects where you:

- Defined responsible AI guidelines or guardrails.
- Conducted AI usability tests or trust studies.
- Improved model accuracy through better data or prompts.
- Delivered measurable outcomes (e.g., reduced support tickets, increased feature adoption).

Staying relevant in 2025 means combining timeless design craft with AI fluency. Prioritize skills that improve collaboration, protect users, and create measurable value.
