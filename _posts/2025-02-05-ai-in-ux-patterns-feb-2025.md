From suggestions to constrained generation, this guide outlines patterns that are safe, legible, and measurable—plus anti‑patterns to avoid.

## Pattern 1: Guided Suggestions

When AI offers optional suggestions, clarity is everything. Anchor the interaction around a succinct question and show users how the system arrived at each suggestion. Include confidence tags or supporting data points ("Based on similar requests from analytics managers"). Allow dismissal and teach the model from that rejection.

**Instrumentation tips**

- Track suggestion acceptance rate, subsequent edits, and downstream feature adoption.
- Provide an inline feedback affordance so users can flag off-target ideas without leaving the flow.

## Pattern 2: Constrained Generation

For marketing copy, support tickets, or code snippets, constrain the AI to templates or components. Present the generated output in structured blocks with editable fields, not a monolithic blob. Offer a quick switch between variations (tone, length, region) so users feel in control without re-prompting from scratch.

**Implementation hygiene**

- Pre-fill prompt context from system data (persona, previous selections) to reduce user burden.
- Show a preview diff when regenerating to avoid losing valuable edits.

## Pattern 3: Proactive Error Recovery

LLMs still misstep. Build guardrails that detect hallucinations or missing data. If the AI cannot complete a task, escalate gracefully: explain the limit, highlight what information is missing, and route the user to human support or manual tools.

**Key telemetry**

- Monitor fallback frequency and resolution time.
- Tag root causes (model refusal, validation failure, vague prompt) to prioritize training fixes.

## Pattern 4: Transparent Autonomy

Autonomous workflows (e.g., expense approvals, code merges) demand trust. Provide upfront disclosures about what the AI will do, what data it uses, and how to stop it. After completion, deliver an audit log with timestamps, triggers, and reasoning steps. Allow easy rollback.

## Anti-Patterns to Avoid

- **Prompt capture UX:** Dumping a blank textbox with “Ask me anything” leads to inconsistent experiences. Offer structured intents instead.
- **Opaque editing:** If the system silently rewrites user content, trust erodes. Highlight changes using track edits or badges.
- **Static disclaimers:** Legal disclaimers alone do not build confidence. Pair them with clear controls and educational microcopy.

## Designing Feedback Loops

Real-world usage should continually refine the model. Create a triage workflow that routes low-confidence outputs to human review. Feed the resulting annotations into your fine-tuning or retrieval pipeline on a regular cadence. Communicate with users when their feedback leads to improvements—this reinforces engagement and keeps the loop alive.

## Bringing AI Patterns into Your Design System

Document each pattern in your design system with:

- Triggers and required data inputs.
- Recommended UI components (chips, accordions, skeleton states).
- Accessibility considerations (live region updates, focus management during generation).
- Telemetry events to implement.

When AI work stays aligned with the design system, teams avoid reinventing basic flows and can focus on the nuanced problem of trust.

## Getting Started Checklist

- Choose one core use case with a clear success signal.
- Document the happy path, edge cases, and failure responses.
- Prototype the pattern in your design system tooling; test accessibility early.
- Instrument analytics before launch—retrofits always cost more.
- Establish a review cadence where designers, PMs, and engineers audit AI interactions together.

Thoughtful AI patterns respect user agency. When you combine transparent behavior, tight guardrails, and measurable feedback loops, you unlock automation that feels empowering instead of risky.
