## Design Process

I follow a human-centered design approach that puts users at the heart of every decision:

1. **Research & Discovery** - Understanding user needs and business goals
2. **Ideation & Strategy** - Brainstorming solutions and defining strategy
3. **Design & Prototyping** - Creating wireframes, mockups, and interactive prototypes
4. **Testing & Validation** - User testing and iterative improvements
5. **Implementation & Launch** - Working with development teams for successful delivery

## Tools & Technologies

- **Design:** Figma, Sketch, Adobe Creative Suite
- **Prototyping:** Principle, InVision, Framer
- **Research:** UserTesting, Maze, Optimal Workshop
- **Collaboration:** Miro, Notion, Slack
